# Kelvin's Better Player Animations

KBPA with 1.20 support and some minor fixes

[Snapshot v2.0](https://github.com/mrzenc/kelvins-better-anims/releases/tag/v2.0-snapshot) is a complete rewrite of code from scratch with a lot of bugs. If you want to play with this mod, please use [v1.0](https://github.com/mrzenc/kelvins-better-anims/releases/tag/v1.0-snapshot) instead

Also keep in mind that it is for my personal use only so this can be abandoned for a long period of time. PRs are always welcomed :)
